# TutorWizard
Tutor Wizard is a multi-purpose problem solving program designed for students who need assistance with the modules.
Program aims to demonstrate a math and cyber security techniques viz: geometri funcation for math and encryption / decryption for cyber security.

Current program covers following python notations:

I/O – Input and output
Assignment
Data Types
Conditional Statements
Boolean Operators
Loops
Lists
User defined functions
Graphics
Files

Libraries:

1) **OS** - The first imported module [OS] was used to resize the terminal interface of the user rather than the default resolution to allocate more space for the user prompts making it easier to perceive by the user.

2) **Math** – The Maths python library includes a function required in both the MA3101 and CC3101 sub-module parts. “math.sqrt()” is used from the math library in order to find the roots of an integer.

3) **Turtle** – In order for the second sub-function “draw_Triangle()” within the MA3101 to work, the turtle library was essential to construct the triangles given the suitable command to move the turtle in any direction or distance.

4) **Tkinter** – The final module required [Tkinter] was necessary in order for the start-up splash screen to function.

Functionality:

The maths module consists of three main functions; “**which_Triangle()**” which is responsible for finding the type of triangle from the users inputted measure of sides, “**draw_Triangle()**” 
which is responsible for accurately drawing a triangle from the users inputted measure of sides and angles and finally 
“**area_Triangle**” which finds the total area of a triangle only given the measure of sides. 

The cyber security module is responsible for the encryption and decryption of corresponding messages by using a modified version of Caesar Cipher.  
The code itself consisted of three functions: “dep encrypt ()” which is responding for encryption, “dep decrypt ()” which is responding for 
decryption and “dep choice ()” which is giving the user a choice between encryption and decryption tasks. 


PS

Current program was build using Python 2.7 so, please make sure that it is executed in appropriate version.
